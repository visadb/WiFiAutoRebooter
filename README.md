# WiFiAutoRebooter

This is a small background service for Android that monitors internet connectivity by pinging google. If connectivity is lost, WiFiAutoRebooter will switch WiFi off and back on again to attempt to regain connectivity.

This is a kludge for my Archos 7 Home Tablet whose WiFi goes bad often.
